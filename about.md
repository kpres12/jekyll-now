Some information about me!
Hi, I’m Kyle Prest! After several years in software sales, I’ve switched gears and am diving into the world of cybersecurity. I’m prepping for my ISC² certification and planning to earn a master’s degree in Cybersecurity from WGU. Outside of tech, I’m an LSU alum (Geaux Tigers!) with a love for golf, great coffee, and traveling to new places. Whether I’m exploring a new city or tackling a CTF challenge, I’m always up for a new adventure. Thanks for stopping by—let’s connect!
