# **Progress in Cryptography**

As I continue to shift from software sales into cybersecurity, I’ve found myself getting more and more interested in **cryptography**. It’s a fascinating field that blends complex math with real-world applications, all centered around keeping our digital lives secure. The deeper I go, the more I appreciate just how crucial cryptography is in today’s world.

## **Why Cryptography?**

Cryptography plays a huge role in digital security. It’s all about protecting data—whether it’s securing communication channels or keeping sensitive information safe from prying eyes. For someone like me, who enjoys problem-solving, cryptography offers a satisfying mix of challenges and real-world impact. It’s not just theory; it’s practical and essential.

## **What I’ve Been Working On**

Lately, I’ve been diving into various encryption algorithms and trying to understand how they’re used in different contexts. I started with the basics—things like **Caesar** and **Vigenère ciphers**—to get a solid foundation. From there, I’ve been working my way up to more advanced algorithms like **AES** and **RSA**.

Here’s a bit of what I’ve been up to:

- **Coding Basic Ciphers**: I’ve been writing some simple ciphers in Node.JS (I'll add the code to my github page later). It’s been a great way to really get a feel for the nuts and bolts of cryptography.
- **Learning About Key Management**: Keys are at the heart of cryptography, so I’ve been digging into how they’re generated, distributed, and managed. It’s a crucial part of building secure systems.
- **Exploring Modern Encryption**: I’ve also been getting to know symmetric and asymmetric encryption better, focusing on **AES** and **RSA**. These are the algorithms that keep our data safe today, and understanding them has been both challenging and rewarding.

## **Challenges and Lessons Learned**

One of the biggest hurdles has been wrapping my head around the math behind these algorithms. Coding is one thing, but the theory can be tough. Still, every time I finally “get it,” it’s incredibly satisfying.

Another key takeaway? You’ve got to keep learning in this field. Cybersecurity is always evolving, and cryptography is no different. New techniques and potential vulnerabilities pop up all the time, so staying current is crucial.

## **Looking Ahead**

I’m really excited to keep applying what I’ve learned as I move further into cybersecurity. Cryptography is just one piece of the puzzle, but it’s a big one. I’m looking forward to deepening my understanding and seeing how these concepts play out in real-world scenarios.

A big resource I came across while diving deep is this video here [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ). It was super interesting to watch and learn from, definitely worth checking out.

Thanks for following along as I navigate this new path. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this field!
